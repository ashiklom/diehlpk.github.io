  abstract = {This paper shows a new approach to estimate the critical traction
	for Mode I crack opening before crack growth by numerical simulation.
	For quasi-static loading, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts
	the critical traction before crack growth. To simulate the crack
	growth, we used bond-based peridynamics, a non-local generalization
	of continuum mechanics. We discretize the peridynamics equation of
	motion with a collocation by space approach, the so-called EMU nodal
	discretization. As the constitutive law, we employ the improved prototype
	micro brittle material model. This bond-based material model is verified
	by the Young's modulus from classical theory for a homogeneous deformation
	for different quadrature rules. For the EMU-ND we studied the behavior
	for different ratios of the horizon and nodal spacing to gain a robust
	value for a large variety of materials. To access this wide range
	of materials, we applied sparse grids, a technique to build high-dimensional
	surrogate models. Sparse grids significantly reduce the number of
	simulation runs compared to a full grid approach and keep up a similar
	approximation accuracy. For the validation of the quasi-static loading
	process, we show that the critical traction is independent of the
	material density for most material parameters. The bond-based IPMB
	model with EMU nodal discretization seems very robust for the ratio
	{\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}delta {\}}/{\{}{\backslash}varDelta X{\}}=3{\$}{\$}
	$\delta$ / $\Delta$ X = 3 for a wide range of materials, if an error
	of 5 {\%} is acceptable.},
