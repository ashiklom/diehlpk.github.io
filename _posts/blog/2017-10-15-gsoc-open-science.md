## Open source software
One topic of the discussion's agenda was the why do people, in our case especially researcher, decide to go for proprietary software. These are the points we could determine, including the audience experience made at their institutions.

* Mostly if people search for an open source alternative, they find either one side of the coin. On the front side of the coin is the situation that they find not any suitable open source solution. On the back side is the situation that there ate too many options. Most of them not mainly maintained, e.g. only by one developer. Which comes to the next point,  that for closed software the vendor comes with a guarantee for support. Where as for open source projects with a small community there is no such a guarantee and even worse no guarantee that the software will be maintained for the next years. 
* Also in many cases the education systems, e.g. the UK system has strict regulations to the software catalog, leads future researchers or employees into proprietary software. In most courses closed source software, i.e. Matlab and Maple, is introduced to students for solving their exercises. In this case good open source alternatives, like Octave and Maxima, which are compatible with the proprietary equivalences are available. This influences students for their career and the get addicted/hooked to this software. For example for these to open source alternatives, the learning curve is flat because the syntax is very similar to the closed source one. Another reason is that scientists are often very busy and do not have the time or energy to learn a new software. These issues are strongly related to the power of lobbying which open source communities can not do due to lack of costs. 
* Another aspect is liability which is important for pharmaceuticals or medicine. Here, the software company can be sued because they provide warranty that their implementation of algorithm are correct. Most open source projects have a warranty disclaimer in their licenses.
* A common problem is most institutions Windows and Mac OS X is most common and when it comes to Linux there is a lacking institutional support. One key point is that some open source software works very well on Linux because most developers are using Linux.

### Opportunities

* Having access to the source code can beneficial for finding bugs or gain insight how the algorithm is implemented. Imagine you get strange results with a closed source code and you do not have access to the source code. So it is quite hard to decide if there is a bug in the code or some curiosity in your data. In this case you could have a look into the source code and validate if there is an bug or how the algorithm works exactly. 
* Working with industrial partners or collaborators can lead that they direct you to use proprietary software. In this case some of proprietary software is compatible with open source solutions, e.g. LibreOffice with Microsoft Word and Octave with MatLab.
* To make it easier for specific disciplines, there are discipline-specific Linux distributions, i.e [Scientific Linux](https://www.scientificlinux.org/) for Scientific computing, [Bio Linux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/) for bioinformatics, and [Fedora Scientific](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scientific_Spin) for general purpose in science. These distributions have the most common open source software pre-installed. 
* Provide a virtual machine with Linux and configure it such that all programming exercises can be done with this machine. Students can download this machine and use Linux inside of their common operating system. First, it makes it easier for them to get in touch with Linux and open source software. Second, it also promotes reproducibility for science.

## Open data and open access

* 

### Opportunities

* Nowadays, it is quite common that requirements of openness and reproducibility are defined by journals, institutions, and funding agencies. For example the [German government](https://www.bmbf.de/de/hilfe-bei-kosten-fuer-open-access-4722.html?pk_campaign=RSS&pk_kwd=Pressemeldung) provide a grant where researchers could apply for funding to pay for open access options for publications of previous projects. In some countries all governmental funded research has to be published as open access.
