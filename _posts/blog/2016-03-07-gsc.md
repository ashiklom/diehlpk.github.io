For the third year in a row the <a href="http://stellar-group.org/">Ste||ar Group</a> is attending Google Summer of Code with the topic - Shaping a Scalable Future. If you are interested in High Performance Computing, programming languages and development tools look at our <a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2016-Project-Ideas">ideas list</a> for this year projects. Do not hesitate to contact us via the &#35;ste&#166;&#166;ar IRC channel at freenode for questions about a specific project or suggestions how you like to contribute. Feel free to discuss novel ideas for additional projects with us.

This year we mentored following 4 successful projects

* [HPXFlow](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxflow) - A unified Batch and Stream Processing framework, with added advantage of HPX
* [Scimitar](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/scimitar) - A debugger for HPX
* [Working on Parallel Algorithms for HPX::Vector](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2016-Project-Ideas#work-on-parallel-algorithms-for-hpx) 
* [Plugin Mechanism for thread schedulers in HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2016-Project-Ideas#implement-a-plugin-mechanism-for-thread-schedulers)
