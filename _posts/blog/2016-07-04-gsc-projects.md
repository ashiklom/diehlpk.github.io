Here is a list of all the Google Summer of Code projects I was a mentor for.

## Implement a Map/Reduce Framework (2016)

[Map/Reduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) frameworks are getting more and more popular for big data processing (for example [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/)). By utilizing the unified and standards conforming API of the HPX run time system, we believe to be able to perfectly represent the Map/Reduce programming model. Many applications would benefit from direct support in HPX. This might include adding [Hypertable](http://hypertable.com) or similar libraries to the mix to handle the large data sets Map/Reduce is usually used with.

The project [hpxflow](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxflow) was successfully done by [Aalekh Nigam](https://twitter.com/_aalekh).
